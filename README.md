# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

This documentation presents a comprehensive breakdown of my self-assembled Cybersecurity Home Labâ€”an integrated virtual network of enterprise-grade tools and systems built on VirtualBox, focused on practical, hands-on cybersecurity training. It is a one-stop platform for simulating cyberattacks, deploying security defenses, and practicing incident detection and response. With the use of open-source and enterprise tools, realistic scenarios, and carefully structured components, this project reflects my initiative to replicate a real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) within the confines of a home setup.

The lab provides a multi-tiered environment with tools and targets ranging from SIEM platforms, vulnerability scanners, and firewalls to Active Directory domains and vulnerable machines. Each component interacts as part of a cohesive ecosystem governed by custom firewall rules, DHCP services, and SIEM correlation. It is purpose-built for practicing ethical hacking, cyber defense, threat intelligence integration, log analysis, and adversary emulation.

## Core Security Stack Components

### pfSense (Firewall + Gateway)

pfSense plays a foundational role in the lab, offering packet filtering, NAT, port forwarding, DHCP, and DNS services. Firewall rules were crafted to simulate segmentation and least-privilege access between the VMs. Logs are continuously monitored and exported via remote syslog to Wazuh.

Noteworthy configurations include:

- DHCP Range: `10.10.1.50 - 10.10.1.100`
- DNS Forwarder: Configured for internal and external name resolution
- OpenVPN (Planned): To simulate secure remote access

### Wazuh (SIEM + XDR)

Wazuh acts as the brain of the security monitoring system. Installed on Ubuntu (`10.10.1.49`), it collects logs and telemetry from:

- Windows Server (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon)
- Ubuntu Server + Docker (Auditd + Syslog)
- Kali Linux (Command Execution Monitoring)
- pfSense (Firewall and DHCP logs via syslog)

Wazuh policies were configured to:

- Monitor file integrity, kernel module loads, and SSH sessions
- Detect brute-force, privilege escalation, and remote access attempts
- Enrich logs with GeoIP and MITRE ATT&CK tags

## Active Directory Simulation

The Windows Server 2022 domain controller was used to simulate an enterprise-grade IT infrastructure, providing centralized authentication, user and device management, and policy enforcement across the lab environment.

### Key Configurations:

- **Domain Name:** `anish.local`
- **Domain Controller IP:** `10.10.1.80`
- **DNS & AD Roles:** Configured on the same Windows Server instance
- **Time Synchronization:** Ensured for all clients to avoid Kerberos authentication issues

### Organizational Units and Group Policies:

To emulate real-world structure and access control, Active Directory was organized into:

- `Admins`: for users with elevated privileges and administrative access.
- `Workstations`: containing domain-joined machines and standard users.
- `Interns`: limited-privilege accounts with restricted access and login times.

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) were deployed to enforce:

- Password complexity, length, and expiration policies
- Drive mappings to shared resources (e.g., `\\10.10.1.80\share`)
- Login hour restrictions for interns
- Disabling removable media and command prompt for standard users
- Configured Windows Defender and audit policies

### Windows 10 Client Integration:

The Windows 10 workstation (`10.10.1.90`) was successfully domain-joined to `anish.local`, and used for:

- Remote administration testing via RDP and MMC tools
- Testing account lockout, privilege escalation, and policy enforcement
- Applying GPOs and validating them using `gpresult` and `rsop.msc`
- Validating DNS resolution via the domain controller

### Security Use-Cases:

- Enabled Windows Event Forwarding to Wazuh for centralized log correlation
- Used this setup to simulate brute-force attacks and privilege escalation detection
- Employed tools like SharpHound and BloodHound to visualize domain relationships and simulate attacker recon
- Tested MITRE Caldera and Wazuh detection within the domain environment
  
---

## TheHive & Cortex (SOC Integration)

TheHive receives alerts from Wazuh via webhook and opens new cases automatically. Cortex enriches cases using:

- VirusTotal for file hash checks
- IPInfo for attacker geolocation
- MISP (planned) for IOC correlation

Every alert is tracked through:

- Case ID, Source, Severity
- Timeline, Tags, Observable Artifacts

---

## Logging, Monitoring, and Documentation

Log rotation and centralization are handled by:

- Filebeat on Linux hosts
- Event Forwarding from Windows
- Syslog on pfSense

All logs are stored with timestamps, indexed by host, severity, and rule ID. Documentation includes:

- Runbooks for tool deployment
- Incident timelines
- Alert signature customizations

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me understand the complexity of cybersecurity infrastructure, the interdependence between offensive and defensive tools, and the importance of context-driven alerting and incident analysis.

Key takeaways:

- Simulating Enterprise-Grade Environments: Setting up a fully functional Active Directory (AD) with Group Policies, Organizational Units, and a domain-joined Windows client taught me how real corporate environments manage identity, access control, and endpoint governance. It helped me understand how attackers leverage misconfigurations and how defenders can mitigate them.

- Vulnerability Assessment in Context: By deploying Nessus and comparing its output with manual scans from Kali Linux, I learned how to prioritize vulnerabilities, understand CVSS scores, and differentiate between false positives and actionable findings. This experience sharpened my ability to triage risk in real-time.

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Configuring Wazuh agents across Windows, Linux, and even Docker containers exposed me to endpoint-level telemetry like process creation, file integrity, registry modifications, and system calls. I gained insight into how attackers leave traces, and how EDR solutions detect, correlate, and escalate those traces.

- Incident Detection and Response Lifecycle: Through simulated attacks using MITRE Caldera and the analysis of resulting alerts in Wazuh, I practiced real-world incident response techniques. I learned how to recognize indicators of compromise (IoCs), follow alert timelines, and respond using structured workflows (e.g., isolating hosts, escalating cases to TheHive).

- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Wazuhâ€™s real-time monitoring of system binaries and configuration files helped me understand the importance of change detection as a critical layer of defense. I configured alerts for unauthorized changes to sensitive files and tested how tampering was reported.

- Log Correlation and Alert Tuning: I realized that simply forwarding logs isn't enoughâ€”log normalization, categorization, and rule tuning are essential to minimize noise. I wrote and adjusted custom Wazuh rules to reduce false positives and enrich true positives with MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

- Red vs Blue Team Interplay: The combination of Kali Linux as the offensive platform and Wazuh + TheHive as the defense stack gave me a 350-degree view of cyber operations. I learned how attacks unfold and how defenders observe and react to them. Each offensive move became a learning opportunity for defensive detection.

- Containerized Security Testing: Running vulnerable apps like DVWA, bWAPP, and WebGoat in Docker containers allowed me to safely conduct repeatable web application security tests. It also introduced me to DevSecOps practices like container hardening, network segmentation, and image scanning.

- Case Management and Automation: Integrating TheHive and Cortex showed me how SOCs manage incidents, correlate observables, and enrich cases automatically via tools like VirusTotal and IPInfo. I gained hands-on experience in how incident triage workflows are built.
